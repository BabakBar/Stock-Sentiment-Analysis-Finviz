# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-Finviz
Stack: Python - NLTK, BeatifulSoup, matplot
Scrape news headlines from Finviz for FB and TSLA then apply sentiment analysis to generate investment insight.
Project Description:

It used to take days for financial news to spread via radio, newspapers, and word of mouth. Now, in the age of the internet, it takes seconds. In this project, I will generate investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from Finviz. Using this natural language processing technique, we will understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock.
The datasets used in this project are raw HTML files for the Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) stocks.
